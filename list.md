1. Design the database schema: [FIXED]
    Choose a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a database. [FIXED]

    Design the schema to store the character stats. For example, you might have a table called "Characters" with columns such as "name," "strength," "speed," etc. [FIXED]
2. Acquire and clean the data:
    Identify reliable sources that provide the Rocky movie boxing character stats. [FIXED]

    Use Python for web scraping and data cleaning. [FIXED]

    Libraries you can use include:
        BeautifulSoup: For parsing and navigating HTML or XML documents. [FIXED]
        
        Requests: For sending HTTP requests to the source website. [FIXED]

    Write functions to scrape the relevant data from the source website, extract the necessary information, and store it in your database. [FIXED]

3. Set up the backend:
    Choose Python as the server-side programming language. [FIXED]
    Select a web framework such as Flask or Django. [FIXED]

    -create api routes and points [PERHAPSFIXED]
    -create logic for calculating match up from info from api point [FIXED]
    
    Install the necessary libraries using pip or a package manager. [FIXED]
    Define routes and APIs:
        Use Flask: Define routes using decorators to handle different URL endpoints. [FIXED]

    Implement data storage and retrieval:
        Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy (with Flask) or Django ORM (with Django) to interact with the database and define models representing your database tables. [FIXED]
    Implement functions or methods to retrieve character stats from the database based on user requests. 

    Implement matchup calculation:
        Write Python functions to calculate the matchup percentages based on the retrieved character stats. [FIXED]
4. Set up the frontend:
    -set up frontend, set up axios endpoints to access info
    Choose JavaScript as the client-side programming language.
    Design the user interface:
        Use HTML to structure the page.
        Use CSS for styling.
        Utilize JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to create a dynamic and interactive UI.
    Connect to the backend:
        Use JavaScript AJAX or fetch requests to communicate with the backend APIs you defined earlier.
    Display stats and matchup results:
        Dynamically populate the UI with the received data from the backend.
        Use JavaScript to perform any necessary calculations or formatting of the data.
5. Deploy the application:
        Choose a hosting platform like Heroku, AWS, or Azure to deploy your application.
        Configure the server environment and deploy your backend and frontend code.
        Set up the necessary server and database settings, ensuring they are accessible to the deployed application.
6. Test and refine:
        Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the website functions correctly.
        Test the web scraping functions to ensure they collect accurate data.
        Test the backend API endpoints to verify they return the expected results.
        Test the frontend UI to ensure it displays the data and matchup results correctly.

Iterate and refine your code based on testing results and user feedback.
